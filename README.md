# Pursuits
Data and scripts for analyzing the fatalities associated with police pursuits in WA since 2015. 

To replicate the workflow that produces the [online pursuits report](https://rpubs.com/moxbox/wa_pursuits), 
you will also need to fork a copy of the [WA-FEWP](https://github.com/nextstepswa/WA-FEWP) repository.
The clean datafiles in that repository provide the starting point for the pursuit dataset construction.
