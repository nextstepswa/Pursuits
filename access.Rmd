This report follows the principles of transparent, reproducible science.  All of the scripts, data and software are open source and freely available to the public, online.

____

> The scripts needed to reproduce this report are posted on our public [GitHub Pursuits Repository](https://github.com/nextstepswa/Pursuits). 

____

Note that the source data files must first be constructed using the scripts in the 
[GitHub Fatal Encounters / Washington Post repository](https://github.com/nextstepswa/fewapo).

The software used to produce this report comes from the open-source [R project](https://www.r-project.org/).  You can view the code in the report itself by clicking the `Code` buttons in the right margin, or you can download all of the scripts from the repository.

**R** is free and runs on most Unix, Windows and MacOS operating systems.  The report script uses [rmarkdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/) and [knitr](https://www.rstudio.com/tags/knitr/).
